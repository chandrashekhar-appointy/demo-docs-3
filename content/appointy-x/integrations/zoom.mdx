## Purpose of Integration

AppointyX integrates with Zoom to provide users the capability to automatically generate and manage Zoom meeting links for virtual services and appointments. This offers a dedicated video conferencing option alongside other potential integrations like Google Meet.

## Core Technology: Zoom API and Authentication

The integration leverages Zoom's APIs, primarily utilizing the "General App" type.

- **General App (OAuth 2.0)**: This app type allows AppointyX to perform actions (e.g., create a meeting) on behalf of an authorized AppointyX user (staff member) using the OAuth 2.0 protocol. This is crucial for ensuring meetings are associated with the correct host.
- Typically, "General Apps" intended for widespread use must be published on the Zoom Marketplace, which involves a review and verification process by Zoom.
- Other Zoom app types like "Server-to-Server OAuth" (actions on behalf of the AppointyX application itself, not a user) and "Webhook Only" (for receiving notifications) are not the primary models for our core meeting creation functionality.

## Environment-Specific Configurations

### Production Environment

- **App Type**: Utilizes a \*\*[published "General App"](https://marketplace.zoom.us/apps/69Uj2wsvQZOuuRpCFNljiA) on the Zoom Marketplace.
- **Authentication**: Employs a standard OAuth 2.0 flow, allowing AppointyX staff users to authorize the application to manage Zoom meetings on their behalf.
- **Credential Source**: Uses a set of production-grade application credentials (Client ID, Client Secret) configured for the AppointyX platform.
- **Capability**: Supports the creation of Zoom meetings for scheduled appointments linked to authenticated staff members.

### Development (Dev) & Quality Assurance (QA) Environments

- **App Type**: Currently utilizes an unpublished "General App".
- **Authentication & Setup**:
  - This app is presently configured using credentials (Client ID, Client Secret) associated with an individual developer's Zoom account.
  - This setup was implemented as an interim measure for initial development and local testing by that specific developer.
  - Due to Zoom's restrictions, testing is limited to localhost only as redirect URIs cannot be configured for other environments.
- **Current Limitations & Implications for Dev/QA**:
  - Non-Representative OAuth Flow: This configuration does not fully replicate the production OAuth 2.0 flow where various team members or test user accounts can independently authorize and use the Zoom integration.
  - Restricted Testing: Testing the Zoom integration comprehensively on deployed Dev or QA environments by the broader team is challenging.
  - Debugging Constraints: The inability for multiple testers to easily use the integration with different Zoom accounts in Dev/QA environments complicates thorough debugging.
  - Environment Limitation: Due to Zoom's OAuth restrictions for unpublished apps, testing can only be done on localhost.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### Integration Server ([integration/zoom.go](https://gitlab.com/appointy/waqt/meetings/-/blob/master/integration/zoom.go))

- Handles OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- Manages token refresh and revocation
- Implements user connection and metadata management
- Base URL: https://api.zoom.us/v2

#### Controller ([zoom/controller.go](https://gitlab.com/appointy/waqt/meetings/-/blob/master/zoom/controller.go))

- Manages meeting creation, updates, and deletion
- Handles Zoom settings and configurations
- Implements meeting event management
- Provides user and calendar linking functionality

### Key Features

#### Meeting Management ([core.go](https://gitlab.com/appointy/waqt/meetings/-/blob/master/core.go))

```go
type SettingObject struct {
    HostVideo        bool
    ParticipantVideo bool
    JoinBeforeHost   bool
    MuteUponEntry    bool
    WaitingRoom      bool
    // ... other settings
}
```

#### OAuth Flow Implementation ([integration/zoom.go](https://gitlab.com/appointy/waqt/meetings/-/blob/master/integration/zoom.go))

```go
func (z *zoom) Connected(ctx context.Context, in *intPb.ConnectedRequest) (*intPb.IntegrationToken, error) {
    // Handles OAuth code exchange
    // Retrieves user information
    // Stores integration tokens
}
```

#### Token Management

- Access tokens expire in 1 hour (refreshed after 50 minutes)
- Refresh tokens expire in 15 years
- Automatic token refresh mechanism

## Key Considerations & Configuration Notes

- The primary difference in Zoom integration between Production and non-production (Dev/QA) environments lies in the nature and scope of the "General App" configuration and its associated OAuth flow.
- The current Dev/QA setup is a known constraint that impacts the breadth and depth of pre-production testing for Zoom-related features.
- Strategies are being evaluated to establish a more robust and representative Zoom "General App" configuration for Dev and QA environments.

## Credential Management

- For information regarding the specific Zoom application credentials (Client ID, Client Secret) used in any environment, please coordinate with Infra-Team.
- For Dev/QA environment credentials and access, contact Vibhu directly at vibhu@appointy.com.

```json
{
  "itype": 10,
  "name": "ZOOM",
  "client_id": "<client_id>",
  "client_secret": "<client_secret>",
  "redirect_uri": "<redirect_uri>"
}
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Generate protocol buffer code
make proto

# Run tests
go test ./...
```

## API Implementation Details

### Meeting Creation ([zoom/controller.go](https://gitlab.com/appointy/waqt/meetings/-/blob/master/zoom/controller.go))

```go
func (s *Core) AddMeetingEvent(ctx context.Context, in *pb.AddMeetingEventRequest) (*pb.MeetingEvent, error) {
    // Validates request
    // Retrieves Zoom settings
    // Creates meeting with specified configuration
    // Returns meeting event with join URL
}
```

### Meeting Updates ([zoom/controller.go](https://gitlab.com/appointy/waqt/meetings/-/blob/master/zoom/controller.go))

```go
func (s *Core) UpdateMeetingEvent(ctx context.Context, in *pb.UpdateMeetingEventRequest) (*pb.MeetingEvent, error) {
    // Updates existing meeting
    // Handles time/settings changes
    // Returns updated meeting event
}
```

### User Management ([zoom/controller.go](https://gitlab.com/appointy/waqt/meetings/-/blob/master/zoom/controller.go))

```go
func (s *Core) ListZoomUsers(ctx context.Context, in *pb.ListZoomUsersRequest) (*pb.ListZoomUsersResponse, error) {
    // Retrieves connected Zoom users
    // Handles pagination
    // Returns user list with metadata
}
```

### Settings Management ([zoom/controller.go](https://gitlab.com/appointy/waqt/meetings/-/blob/master/zoom/controller.go))

```go
func DefaultZoomSetting() *pb.ZoomSetting {
    return &pb.ZoomSetting{
        HostVideo:        true,
        ParticipantVideo: true,
        JoinBeforeHost:   false,
        MuteUponEntry:    true,
        WaitingRoom:      true,
        // ... other default settings
    }
}
```

### Error Handling

The integration implements comprehensive error handling and logging:

- OAuth errors
- API rate limits
- Token expiration/refresh failures
- Meeting creation/update failures

### Security Considerations

#### Token Storage

- Access tokens are stored securely
- Refresh tokens are encrypted
- Token rotation is automated

#### User Authentication

- OAuth 2.0 flow for user authorization
- Scope-based access control
- Meeting authentication options

#### Meeting Security

- Configurable waiting rooms
- Meeting password support
- Host controls and restrictions
